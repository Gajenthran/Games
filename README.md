# iamGame
iamGame groups all of my game under differents programming languages (C, Java). It's a way for me to discover new languages and various techniques to create games. iamGame is a temporary title.

## C
- Connect 4, realized via SDL, based on the game Connect 4 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four).
- Rally-X, realized via SDL and Ncurses, based on the driving game Rally X (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally-X).

## Java
- Mario_Like, realized via JavaFX, based on plateform games and in particular Mario Bros (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game).
